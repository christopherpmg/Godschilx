With Understanding we're in Agreement 
We've heard the saying, if you know better your do better
I'm afraid that it's true. It's hard to blame a person if they don't know. Knowledge is knowing.A person environment an their peers is what informs then. At the age of ten I really thought going to the penitentiary was apart of male adult hood. It was never explained an all my older cousins was going in as they aged.
Without a understanding of faith, a person only believe in what there taught are experienced. One man rights can be another's wrong . It all depends on there teachings an culture. So before we start judging others
On there lack of understanding. Remember it's your lack of understanding them. That's got you judging. As the bible an most creeds teaches. In all your getting. Get understanding Godschilx
